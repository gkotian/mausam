Mausam
======

An amateur attempt at an Android weather app.

I decided one fine day in early 2013 to experiment a little with Android. At
that time, I hadn't the slightest clue that one makes Android applications using
Java. I was to discover this to my great disappointment in the first hour that I
started reading about it. I am not against Java per se, but Java wasn't even
remotely in the list of programming languages that I wanted to learn at the time
(I was looking at getting familiar with D, Go, JavaScript & Lua).

But I decided to go ahead nevertheless and chose to make a simple weather app.
My aim was simply to use the api:
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London
to get some weather data and show it.

I managed to get the app up and running, but it wasn't pretty. I hadn't had as
much fun in the process as I'd hoped, so I abandoned it the next day.
It's not code I'm proud of, and I'm unlikely to go back to it; but I thought I'd
create a repository anyway.


PS: Mausam means weather in Hindi (derived from Arabic).
